# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

# Key Concepts and Challenges
- Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction.
- Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
- Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
- Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-Learn).
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
- Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and actual values.

# How to Run
- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries.
- Run the Jupyter notebook "Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression.ipynb" to see the code implementation.
